High-performance C++ code for finite element modeling

This code reads voxels and generates cartesian mesh finite element model in the format of Abaqus .inp file.
It is ideally suited for Micro Computed Tomography data.
A full description how the code works and how the input data should be prepared can be found in this paper:
